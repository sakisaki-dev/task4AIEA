task4AIEA: Introduction to Prolog and Python Integration üêçüß†
A repository demonstrating the fundamentals of Prolog (a declarative, logic programming language) and how to seamlessly integrate it with a Python application. This project is likely part of a task or assignment focused on Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems (AIEA).

Project Description
This project serves as an introductory guide to logic programming using Prolog and showcases a practical example of integrating a Prolog-based knowledge base into a standard Python workflow.

The core idea is to leverage Prolog for tasks requiring logical inference, rule-based decision-making, or knowledge representation, while using Python for the main application logic, data handling, and user interface.

Key learning points in this repository include:

Defining facts and rules in a Prolog knowledge base (.pl file).

Using a Python library to query the Prolog engine.

Passing variables and retrieving solutions from the Prolog engine back into Python.

Files Overview
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

SWI-Prolog: The Prolog interpreter is required for the integration library to function.

Python 3.x: The main language for the application code.

Installation
1. Install SWI-Prolog
Ensure you have SWI-Prolog installed on your system and that its executables are accessible from your system's PATH.


2. Set up Python Environment
Clone the repository and install the necessary Python dependencies.

Note: The primary Python library for Prolog integration is likely pyswip, which requires a correctly installed SWI-Prolog. If you encounter issues, please check the pyswip installation instructions for your specific OS.

Usage
To run the demonstration of Prolog-Python integration, execute the main Python script:

This script will:

Initialize the Prolog engine.

Consult (load) the kb.pl knowledge base.

Execute pre-defined queries against the knowledge base.

Print the results of the logical inferences performed by Prolog.

Example Prolog Query (Hypothetical)
You can inspect the python_prolog_demo.py file to see how queries are constructed, for example:

You can also modify the kb.pl file to add your own facts and rules and then update the python_prolog_demo.py script to query your new knowledge.
